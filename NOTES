- What does it take to effectively fuzz network applications?
    - packet-based vs. monolithic inputs
    - state-graph ?
    - which additional algorithms come into play? state selector, ...
        - in how far can we adapt state of the art algos (MOpt, cmplog, etc.) into stateful fuzzing
    - maximize throughput
    - better input generation / mutation operators
    - applicability: can it fuzz clients like curl as well as servers ?
    - how to track state: responses vs. variables
    - what about state that is preserved across executions like fs?

Testcase scheduling:
- Pick an underutilized state
- Call other schedulers on the subset of the testcases reaching the selected state
- MinimizerScheduler ?
