- What does it take to effectively fuzz network applications?
    - packet-based vs. monolithic inputs
    - state-graph ?
    - which additional algorithms come into play? state selector, ...
        - in how far can we adapt state of the art algos (MOpt, cmplog, etc.) into stateful fuzzing
    - maximize throughput
    - better input generation / mutation operators
    - applicability: can it fuzz clients like curl as well as servers ?
    - how to track state: responses vs. variables
    - what about state that is preserved across executions like fs?

Testcase scheduling:
- Pick an underutilized state
- Call other schedulers on the subset of the testcases reaching the selected state
- MinimizerScheduler ?

Reproduce: CVE-2020-9273 in ProFTPD
  - patch: https://github.com/Sashan/proftpd/commit/e845abc1bd86eebec7a0342fded908a1b0f1996b
  - vulnerable commit: 9fb4ee81c65026c7c0a6b19b8b3540f30b9bb5fd
  - part of oss-fuzz but they only fuzz some custom JSON parser there ???

FTP:
  - PASV: open(1)
  - STOR(data): send(0), send(1), close(1)
  - RETR: send(0)
  
Next: Add connection stack to libdragonfly and specify in dragonfly which packet shall be sent over which connection on stack.
      If required connection is not open then skip packet.
