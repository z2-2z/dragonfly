- What does it take to effectively fuzz network applications?
    - packet-based vs. monolithic inputs
    - state-graph ?
    - which additional algorithms come into play? state selector, ...
        - in how far can we adapt state of the art algos (MOpt, cmplog, etc.) into stateful fuzzing
    - maximize throughput
    - better input generation / mutation operators
